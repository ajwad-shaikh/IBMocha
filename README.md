### A Caffeinated Solution To Privacy

```
Modern Problems Require Modern Solution
```
In the race to big data solutions and data-driven analytics, it is important to preserve the privacy of the information source as data propagates into the loops of the Internet.

IBMocha is a hack on IBM Watson NLU tools to utilize the power of Machine Learning Cloud Infrastructure to redact sensitive information on the Internet.

If you are a web-admin, you can use this code to look for potential exposure of private data on your pages. This can help you screen your website for possible **GDPR Violations**.

IBMocha is also modelled to target the recent [outbreak of Aadhaar Card Data](https://github.com/fs0c131y/AadhaarSearchEngine) that exploited search engine crawlers.
